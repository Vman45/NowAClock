These images are courtesy of [NASA's Scientific Visualization
Studio](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4404).  I wanted a series of images
representing the phases of the moon but did not worry about accurately
representing libration, diameter, etc.  The images depict the moon every
hour so I chose to use the lunar cycle starting on March 9, 2016 because
the full moon occurred right on the hour on [March 23, 2016 at 12:00
UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/timezone/utc?year=2016) which
is depicted in frame 1981 of that year's animation.  That cycle's duration
was 29 days, 9 hours and 29 minutes which is equivalent to 705.483 hours.
I wanted images for every 1/16 of the cycle (44.093 hours) so the following
frames are used to depict the phases:

|Fraction|Frame|Phase|
|-|-|-|
|0/16|1628|New Moon|
|1/16|1672||
|2/16|1716|Waxing crescent|
|3/16|1761||
|4/16|1805|First quarter|
|5/16|1849||
|6/16|1893|Waxing gibbous|
|7/16|1937||
|8/16|1981|Full Moon|
|9/16|2025||
|10/16|2069|Waning gibbous|
|11/16|2113||
|12/16|2157|Third quarter|
|13/16|2201||
|14/16|2246|Waning crescent|
|15/16|2290||
